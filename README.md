# GrandStrandSystems
For this project, I am a software engineer for Grand Strand Systems, a software engineering company that focuses on developing and testing back-end services. I am assignment to develop a mobile application for a customer, who gave me the requirements. To complete my assignment, I had to code up the application and provide unit tests.

Based on the work submitted throughout the past eight weeks, reflect on the following questions: 

**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?** 

To ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure, I focus on a few essential practices. First, I always begin with clear and organized planning, which includes defining precise requirements and specifications. Then, I write clean, well-commented, and modular code to lower the amount of maintenance and updates that would be necessary otherwise. Testing is key, so I incorporate different types of tests such as unit, integration, and security tests, and I use automated testing tools whenever possible. Finally, I prioritize security from the start, implementing best practices like input validation, using secure coding standards, and keeping dependencies up to date.

**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?** 

When interpreting user needs and incorporating them into a program, I begin by engaging with the users directly to gather detailed requirements. I use interviews, surveys, and user testing to understand their challenges and expectations clearly. This feedback helps in creating user stories and personas that guide the software development process. I always aim to build a flexible design that can adapt to changing user needs, ensuring that the software remains relevant and user-friendly.

**How do I approach designing software?** 

My approach to designing software revolves around a strong planning and design phase. I use methodologies like agile development to stay adaptable throughout the development process. I often start with creating wireframes or prototypes to visualize the user interface and experience. For the architecture, I prefer designs that promote scalability, maintainability, and security. This includes choosing the right software design patterns, adhering to the principles of clean architecture, and considering the long-term impact of design choices on future development and maintenance.
